# JavaFX WebView debugger

There is not much left here, and there is a good reason for it:

First of all, after Microsoft took over GitHub, I started moving all my OS code over to GitLab. So basically you can find the original code of this project [here on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mohamnag/javafx-webview-debugger).

Second, Vladimir Schneider has invested a lot of his time and developed a way more advanced debugger based on the same idea and generously made it OS [here](https://github.com/vsch/Javafx-WebView-Debugger). I would recommend you try using that.
